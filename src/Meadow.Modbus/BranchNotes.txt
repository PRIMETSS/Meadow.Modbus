Stopped development on this branch as it was working under high speed load, however after consideration the recovery of data flow after a break (Wireless links) 
in data path caused library not to recover and go into a CRC loop. Mainly because packet frame recovery doesnt currenly take place.

Refer hand written notes written for a possible Github Issue being raised on multiple issues & possible solutions, using a Fixed & Varible packet handling concept.
Issues noted including non standard ModbusRTU funcation names and methods. Also a possible simple way to recover from CRC framing errors using clearing serial port buffer if correct response
was not received from the last request.

Since no response from previous PR & Issues posted to Github, I have decided to fork the library and continue development on my own forked branch at this time.

** Aug 2023 PR was accepted & merged into the Meadows Modbus library, however is missing WriteMultipleCoils feature! 
	Ref GitHub Issue about adding this from PTSS Repo https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Modbus/issues/26
